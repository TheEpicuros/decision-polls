# Ranked Polls Display Fix - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

I've implemented **Option A** from the implementation guide by making direct changes to the necessary files:

### 1. Modified `includes/core/models/class-vote.php`:

- Added different SQL ordering for ranked polls vs standard/multiple polls:
  ```php
  $is_ranked = ($poll['type'] === 'ranked');
  $order_by = $is_ranked ? 'r.votes_count DESC' : 'r.votes_count DESC, a.sort_order ASC';
  ```

- Added an explicit rank field to the results data for ranked polls:
  ```php
  if ($is_ranked) {
      $result_data['rank'] = $rank;
  }
  ```

- Modified the return value to include the poll type:
  ```php
  return array(
      'poll_id'      => (int) $poll_id,
      'poll_type'    => $poll['type'], // Added poll type
      'total_votes'  => (int) $total_votes,
      'results'      => $formatted_results,
      'last_updated' => !empty($results) ? $results[0]->last_calculated : current_time('mysql'),
  );
  ```

### 2. Updated `templates/results.php`:

- Modified the rank calculation to use the explicit rank field when available:
  ```php
  // Calculate the rank index using explicit rank field if available, otherwise use array position.
  $rank_index = isset($result['rank']) ? $result['rank'] - 1 : array_search($result, $results_data, true);
  ```

## Testing Procedure

To verify that the changes work correctly:

1. **Test ranked choice polls**:
   - Create a new ranked choice poll with at least 3 options
   - Vote on it with a specific rank order
   - Verify that the results show the options in the correct ranked order
   - Check that the "1st choice", "2nd choice", etc. labels appear correctly

2. **Test that standard and multiple polls still work**:
   - Create and vote on standard and multiple choice polls
   - Verify that they display correctly

## Technical Details

- The issue was that ranked poll results were being sorted primarily by vote count, which doesn't properly reflect the user's selected ranking
- With the new implementation, we:
  1. Sort the results correctly for ranked polls
  2. Add an explicit rank field to the results data
  3. Use this rank field in the template to display the correct rank indicators

## Next Steps

These changes have been committed to the v1.2 branch. To complete the implementation:

1. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   cd temp-decision-polls
   git push -u origin v1.2
   ```

2. Consider implementing the UI improvements mentioned in the implementation guide:
   - Poll container width improvements
   - Theme compatibility enhancements
   - Responsive design improvements
