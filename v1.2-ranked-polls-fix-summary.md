# Ranked Poll Display Fix - Summary

## Problem
When a user submits their ranked choices in a ranked poll, the results still display in the original sorting order rather than showing them in the order the user ranked them.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed in `includes/core/models/class-vote.php`:
- Modified the SQL query in the `get_results` method to properly sort ranked polls by `votes_count DESC` only
- Ensured that ranked polls do not use the original `sort_order` in their sorting
- Added clearer comments to clarify the sorting logic
- Made sure the 'rank' field is added to each result for ranked polls

### 2. Fixed in `templates/results.php`:
- Added a comment to clarify that for ranked polls, we expect the 'rank' field to be set
- The template was already properly using the rank field when available

### 3. Created a fallback mechanism:
- Added `class-decision-polls-ranked-fix-activator.php` which provides a hook-based approach to ensure the rank field is present
- This class serves as a safety net in case the direct code modifications are reverted in the future

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Direct Code Modifications (Implemented)
The following files have been updated:
- `includes/core/models/class-vote.php`
- `templates/results.php`

### Option 2: Plugin Approach (Safety Net)
If direct code modifications are not possible or get overwritten:
1. Include `class-decision-polls-ranked-fix-activator.php` in your theme's functions.php or in a custom plugin
2. The class will automatically hook into the appropriate WordPress filters to fix the ranked poll display

## Testing the Fix
1. Create a ranked poll with multiple options
2. Submit a vote with your preferred ranking
3. Verify that the results display shows the options in the correct ranked order
4. Verify that standard and multiple-choice polls still function normally

## Compatibility
This fix maintains compatibility with all existing functionality and should not affect standard polls or multiple-choice polls.
